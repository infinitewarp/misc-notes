## What is this repo?

Sometimes I lead instructional discussions about general tech subjects. These are my notes for those discussions. I am posting them publicly here for reference.

Disclaimer: _**I am not an expert authority on these subjects.**_ Do not take my words as gospel! This is just a collection of my thoughts and memories (with a few references) that I used as my outline for an in-person conversation. Sometimes I deliberately omit details or over-simplify topics for sake of getting the point across in an informal discussion.
